This example works with MPS 3.4.4 with mbeddr nightly 380 installed.
Here are the URLs to make your own package (just unpack the MPS zip and then unpack the mbeddr zip in the unpacked MPS directory):
MPS: http://download.jetbrains.com/mps/34/MPS-3.4.4.zip
mbeddr: https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/releases/download/nightly-380-MPS-3.4.3/com.mbeddr.allInOne-380-MPS-3.4.3.zip
